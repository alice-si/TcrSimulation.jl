## Multi-agent simulation of Token Curated Registries
This project implements an environment for testing different variations of the
[TCR](https://hackernoon.com/token-curated-registry-tcr-design-patterns-4de6d18efa15) 
crypto-economic protocol. It allows you to parametrize the core TCR algorithm, define the population of users
and see how the curation process works in action and under which conditions it's most effective.
