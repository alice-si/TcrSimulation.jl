## Multi-agent simulation of Token Curated Registries
This project implements an environment for testing different variations of the
[TCR](https://hackernoon.com/token-curated-registry-tcr-design-patterns-4de6d18efa15) 
crypto-economic protocol. Users have the ability to parametrize the core TCR algorithm, define the population of agents
and see how the curation process works in action and under which conditions it's most effective.  

## TCR
Token Curated Registry is a mechanism [introduced by Mike Goldin](https://medium.com/@ilovebagels/token-curated-registries-1-0-61a232f8dac7) where a set of actors collectively create and maintain a list of items by voting on which entry should be admitted to the list. There is an intrinsic token that give the holders voting rights proportional to the amount of tokens they posses. The token works as an incentive system to offer the curators benefits for performing their job judiciously.

In the short term, token holders may get an instant reward for rejecting low quality candidates through the admission mechanism. In order to be considered as a potential list entry, an applicant must put a deposit expressed in the registry tokens. If the item is accepted by the majority of curators the deposit is returned to the applicant. However, if the item is rejected the deposit is divided among those who vote against it, making an instant reward for performing a diligent applicant verification. 

In the long term, a well curated list is expected to gain popularity and increase the number of  applicants willing to be listed. Higher demand for tokens which are necessary to cover the deposit cost will pressure on the price of tokens which are available to be traded on the open market. Therefore, token holders who actively performed the curation process will be rewarded in the increased valuation of their tokens. 

Due to the simplicity of the basic mechanism it's often classified as one of the [crypto-economic primitives](https://medium.com/unframework/mimicables-decentralized-interfaces-introduction-new-crypto-primitive-c8af14910e5d) that could be used as a building block in other blockchain protocols.
